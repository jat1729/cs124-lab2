# Lab 4 Design Document And Decisions

# Introduction
The creators of this to-do list app are Aditya Bhargava (HMC '23) and Joel Tan-Aristy (HMC '24). In this lab, 
we designed and implemented an accessible to-do list using HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, and Firebase. What makes our 
to-do list different from other to-do lists is that we have an option for showing the tasks yet to complete, folders to 
organize our tasks, different ways to sort your tasks, and additional support for multiple screen sizes  

## Accessibility
Using our application entirely from the keyboard:

Using our application using a screen reader:

We provided support for Users with low vision (trouble seeing small print or objects). This was completed by making sure 
that the color contrast between the foreground and background was Normal Text WCAG AA,AAA certified and Large Text WCAG 
AA,AAA certified. The results can be seen below

## Folders
1) Add new folder button color change
2) Delete folder button
3) Sort by creation date

## Multiple Screen Sizes
1) In-edit text mode bug

## Additional Features
1) Clicking/Entering on a task makes it editable
2) Press return when done to save it

## User Testing
We completed user testing for the priority feature of our app and 4 out of 5 users found the exclamation mark to be a
useful icon for priority. They also found the way of incrementing and decrementing the number of exclamation marks to be
intuitive and easy to use. Additionally, all the users found the sorting to be helpful and thought the icons were an
appropriate display of the feature we will sort by.
