# Lab 4 Design Document And Decisions

# Introduction
The creators of this to-do list app are Aditya Bhargava (HMC '23) and Joel Tan-Aristy (HMC '24). In this lab, 
we designed and implemented an accessible to-do list using React, JavaScript, and Firebase. What makes our to-do list 
different from other to-do lists is that we have an option for showing the tasks yet to complete, folders to organize
our tasks, different ways to sort your tasks, and additional support for multiple screen sizes  

## Accessibility

## Folders
1) Add new folder button color change
2) Delete folder button
3) Sort by creation date

## Multiple Screen Sizes
1) In-edit text mode bug

## Additional Features
1) Clicking/Entering on a task makes it editable
2) Press return when done to save it

## User Testing
We completed user testing for the priority feature of our app and 4 out of 5 users found the exclamation mark to be a
useful icon for priority. They also found the way of incrementing and decrementing the number of exclamation marks to be
intuitive and easy to use. Additionally, all the users found the sorting to be helpful and thought the icons were an
appropriate display of the feature we will sort by.
